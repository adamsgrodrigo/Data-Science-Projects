This was a personal project of mine. I decided to take the last 5 years of stock close
prices and put them up against Bitcoin prices.

Overall, I was able to create a model that correctly predicted Bitcoin's price with an
R2 value of 0.99. This means that even with the volatility of Bitcoin, you can very
accurately model its price using only a few global stock indices (especially the total 
US and Tokyo indices!).
